### Directory Structure
```
———— A000000X
 |__ codes
 |__ data
 |__ plots
 |__ writeup.pdf
 |__ writeup.docx
 |__ README.md
```
​
* **codes**: Code files for you to complete
  * Please read the comments carefully in each file, as their instructions show how we may test your implementation
  * To test your implementations, you can run the code using the commands we have additionally provided at the bottom of each code file.
  * If you want to utilize other classes or functions you implement on your own, please also put them in the corresponding code files, instead of adding new code files in the folder.  
  * (The above directives are needed to ensure we can programmatically run and test your code, and may break good software engineering practices)
​
* **data**: corpus to utilize in your code
  * `Prode_and_Prejudice.txt`: the corpus you will work on for Objective 2 & 3
  * `emoticons.txt`: list of emoticons you should consider for Objective 1 (ignore if you don't want to try bonus question)
​
* **plots**: directory for you to save output plot figures.  Check the code directory for sample instructions for plotting.
​
#### Submission
​
* Rename your writeup with your matriculation number (e.g., `A0000000X.pdf`).
​
* Wrap the codes folder, plots folder, and writeup in a `.zip` folder and submit on **Canvas**, also rename it with your matriculation number (e.g., `A0000000X.zip`).
  * The structure of the `.zip` folder should look like:
    ```
    ———— A0000000X
     |__ codes
     |__ plots
     |__ A0000000X.pdf
    ```
